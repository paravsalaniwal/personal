    "One particular challenge I faced was with correctly initializing and updating variables within the code. Specifically, I had difficulty tracking the starting index and length of the longest run of repeated values in the array. This led to incorrect results when I attempted to find the longest run. To help me understand and fix this issue in this FRQ, I was able to find Collegeboard videos to help me as well as people on Youtube analyzing and demonstrating how to solve APCSA FRQs. This helped me understand more about how Java Arrays actually work and helped me fix the concept difficulty I had with the variables."
