# Collaboration with Crossover Team

## What was well
- My code functionality and runtime proof
- My comparison of the code and the scoring guideline requirements
- The step by step walkthrough of how to approach the problem

## What needed work
- The explanation of the code, including adding comments
- Explanation of the question itself

## How I improved it
- I watched a video by AP Collegeboard themselves. 
  - Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKeEoELUXr4)
- I compared with other peers in my class to gain insight
- I presented to more people to see what advice they can give me
