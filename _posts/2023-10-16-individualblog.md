# What I have done

- All of the AWS deployment of our backend server is complete
- Helped in backend code in assisting Shaurya with any issues he's facing
- Helped in frontend code to make an appealing and user-friendly UI

# What I will work on
- I will continue to assist Shaurya in the backend code and testing functionality of our API via Postman once complete
- Once API is complete and functioning, I will do the main part of fetching the API and using GET and POST methods through both frontend and backend repositories
