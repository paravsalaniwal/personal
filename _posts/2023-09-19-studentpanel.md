### Takeaways from lesson:

- CSP projects helped pave the way in matlab classes and scripting classes
- The CS tasks completed in class helped integrate into the future
- First year of college was very easy and simple via taking CSP/CSA by Mr. Mort
- UCSD CS system is lottery system which makes it harder to get in and continue to a degree
- The more applications you send will lead to a greater chance of getting into a college with a directed CS major
- There are separate paths such as CogSci to integrate CS into your major and makes it easier to get into a college and get a degree with (also leads to much more diversity in the classes to take in college)
- Creating a personal portfolio website is beneficial to help display all your progress and achievements
- Internships/Leadership are very useful to gain extra experience outside of school and help the community, leading to strengthen your personal experience and application


### Reflection:

After attending this student panel, as a CSA student, I plan to continue in putting my efforts into this class and try to go above and beyond to complete more tasks and projects. I am currently apart of an internship outside where I work towards web development and I plan on continuing that as it helps me gain experience and also strengthens my application, and plan to make a personal website to help display those projects. CSP was overall a very good learning experience and great way for me to start my computer science education to help integrate into my dream major of data science. Although with the competitiveness, I plan to apply to lots of schools with the targeted major of data science as suggested by these experiences college students. Currently, I may also look to go a little more diverse major which can incorporate CS into it, yet not be as competitive and also not be solely focused on it. I have joined a couple new clubs as leadership related to CS/datasci which will help me gain experience, and I plan to use that experience in my future life to further help me in my career going forward. Overall, this CS student panel from these graduated DN kids helped me rethink and decide what I would like to do in the future through the use of CS as well as learn the challenges and the difficulties I'm expected to face.
