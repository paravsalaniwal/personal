    <h1>Project Collaboration Plan</h1>
        <p> We decided to go with a Translator, in which we can translate any words, phrases, and sentences to any of the common languages that are used in the world. We did this through the use of a Google Translate API which was found via RapidAPI. We plan to use this to help people around the world have an easier way to communicate and understand different languages. </p>
